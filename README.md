### Hi, Iâ€™m Oliver KralðŸ‘‹

My passion is software development and AI, especially computer vision and generative AI. I am enthusiastic about autonomous driving and the modern software-defined vehicle in the automotive sector.
I like the variety between the use of existing technologies and the creative expansion through my own code or the application, fine-tuning and training of AI.

Iâ€™m always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when Iâ€™m playing the violin, studying technologies or tools or simply reading a good book.

### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in
- Automotive sector (autonomous driving and software-defined vehicle concepts)
- Embedded systems
- Rust, C++, Python
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Generative AI
- Software Design Patterns
- Software Development & Testing
- Network Security
- Secure Design
- Algorithms

### What Iâ€™m focusing on

I want always improve my coding and automation skills and my knowledge about AI like deep learning, generative AI and more.
Additionaly I look beyond code being hack coach at hackathon events and doing presentations at stage.
