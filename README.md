### Hi, Iâ€™m Oliver KlapperðŸ‘‹

my passion is to automate manual activities through software programming and automation tools.
I enjoy the variety between the use of existing tools and the creative expansion through custom code or programming tools to automate things by my own.

Iâ€™m always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when Iâ€™m playing the violin, studying languages or tools or simply reading a good book.

### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in
- Software Design Patterns
- Software Devloping & Testing
- Network Security
- Secure Design
- Algorithms

### What Iâ€™m focusing on

I want always improve my coding and automation skills and my knowledge about automated testing processes of todays software.
Additionaly I keep focusing on Network Security Architectures and IT-Security Trends.
